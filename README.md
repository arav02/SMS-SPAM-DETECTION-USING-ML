# SMS-SPAM-DETECTION-USING-ML
The exponential rise in mobile communication has led to a surge in unsolicited SMS messages, commonly known as SMS spam. These unwanted messages not only inundate users' inboxes but also pose security risks and waste valuable resources. The objective of this project is to design and implement a robust machine learning-based SMS spam classifier that can accurately distinguish between legitimate messages and spam, thereby enabling users to filter out unwanted content effectively.
